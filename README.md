# Raspberry-BookPi
Turns your Raspberry Pi into a social writing hub for print and digital books using [Booktype](http://booktype.pro), the collaborative book production platform.

**Note**: this is still being tested. I will delete this note, once this actually works.

## Ubuntu and Debian

These scripts should also run on Ubuntu and Debian. I haven't tried this. One adjustment should be done in Ubuntu:

The webserver root dir is not `/var/www/` but `/var/www/html/`.

You need to change this manually in the script.

## Howto

* run `./install.sh`
